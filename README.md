# Introduction
This repository was created with the aim of build an hub that contains all the write-ups related to the cyber security challenges and CTFs.

All the material was developed for the '*[Security](https://secgroup.dais.unive.it/teaching/security-course/)*' ([first](https://www.unive.it/data/course/274860/programma) and [second](https://www.unive.it/data/course/274861/programma) part) [Ca' Foscari University](https://www.unive.it) master's degree course in '*Software Dependability and Cyber Security*' (2018/2019).

# Statement
This theoretical and practical (laboratory) course teached me techniques that, if used on real systems and applications, might constitute an illegal act. I've studied these techniques with the unique purpose of understanding how to program secure applications and how to prevent possible attacks on the software developed.

# Challenges
Every challenges was designed to get used and to put into practice in *'real'* world situations some new cybersecurity concepts/technologies as reported in the following list.
